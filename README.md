The domain modelled in this project is restaurants in Vancouver mainland. This project is done using CPSC department’s Oracle database system in assistance with PHP.

The aspects of the restaurants we will be modeling consist of two levels. The first level is a general scope about the distribution of different restaurants, which focuses mainly on the types of existing restaurants, i.e., Western or Japanese, distinctive restaurants’ locations and contact information, etc. The second level, also the more specific level, will zoom into a particular restaurant. To be detailed, we will track significant staff, manager, in the maintenance of the restaurant such as designing menus and purchasing ingredients. Further, relationships such as customers’ ordering a dish with consideration of their allergies and customers’ managing their accounts will also be modelled in this level.

With respect to the application, the database is intended to serve as an, to some extent, intellectual and suggestive system rather than a “dull” data source through its well-designed way to manage and manipulate data. The database will be querying the data in a comparable way, i.e. information of some popular restaurant based on customers’ ratings and the comparison between restaurant of different types. Besides, a login system is added to our application to prevent unauthorized people from access to our database and limit different rights to different users.
